# Logo Maker
## Description
This command line application creates a logo based on user input. The user starts by entering "node index.js", then responds to the prompts asking for logo text, text color, logo shape, and shape color. After all prompts have been answered, a logo.svg file is created according to the user's specifications.
## Technologies Used/Dependencies Required
This application utilizes Inquirer to get user input, so users will need to have Inquirer installed as a dependency. It also utilizes Jest for testing purposes, so if a user wants to run the testing suite, they should also install that as a dependency. This application was written in node.js.
